<p>
    You have two empty jars and a lake. Each of the jars have a volume.
    You can fill each jar with water from the lake, pour water from one jar to other or pour water back into lake.
    You should measure the volume of water in <strong>any</strong> jar.
    The required volume of water may be in any of jars and is not matter that in the other.

    Each action is describe as string of two symbols: From and where.
    The jars are marked as <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>, the lake -- <strong>0</strong>.
    If you want to fill first jar, then it's "01". Pour water from second to first -- "21".
    Dump water from first jar back into the lake -- "10".
    When you fill a jar, that jar volume will be full.
    When you pour water out a jar, that jar volume will be empty.
    If you pour water from one jar to another, you can pour only an amount sufficient to fill the full volume of a jar.

    The function has three arguments: The volume of first jar, the volume of second jar and the goal.
    All arguments are positive integers (number > 0).

    You should return a list with action's sequence. If solution does not exist, then return empty list.
    <strong>The solution must contain the minimum number of possible steps</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The volume of first jar, the volume of second jar and the goal.
    Positive integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A sequence of steps. A list with strings.
